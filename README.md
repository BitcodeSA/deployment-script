**Package Description**

This package provides a convenient way to run groups of Artisan commands through a pre-defined configuration file. This
can be useful for automating tasks such as deployment, database maintenance, and testing.

**Features**

* Run groups of Artisan commands with a single command
* Override command options in the configuration file
* Pass values to artisan commands like `--force`.
* Run command like `git pull`.

**Example**

For example, to run the following commands:

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:cache
```

```php
return [
    'commands' => [
        [
            "type" => "artisan",
            "command" => "migrate:fresh"
        ],
        [
            "type" => "artisan",
            "command" => "cache:clear"
        ],
        [
            "type" => "artisan",
            "command" => "route:cache"
        ],
    ],
];
```

Then, you would run the following command:

```
php artisan deploy
```

This package is a valuable tool for any Laravel developer who needs to automate tasks or run groups of Artisan commands
on a regular basis.

        ],

```php
[
// config/deployment-script.php
"production_commands" => [
    [
            "type" => "artisan",
            "command" => "migrate",
            "values" => [
                "--force" => true
            ]
        ],
        [
            "type" => "artisan",
            "command" => "cache:clear",
        ],
